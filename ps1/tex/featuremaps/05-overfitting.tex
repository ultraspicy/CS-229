\item \subquestionpoints{5} {\bf Overfitting with expressive models and small data}

For the rest of the problem, we will consider a small
dataset (a random subset of the dataset you have been using so far) with much fewer examples, provided in
the following file:
%
\begin{center}
	\url{src/featuremaps/small.csv}
\end{center}
%

We will be exploring what happens when the number of features start becoming bigger than the number of 
examples in the training set. Run your algorithm on this small dataset using the following feature map 
\begin{align}
\phi(x) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1\\ x \\ x^2\\ \vdots \\x^k \end{array}\right]\in \mathbb{R}^{k+1} 
\end{align}
with $k = 1,2,5,10,20$. 

Create a plot of the various hypothesis curves (just like previous sub-questions). Observe how the fitting of the training dataset changes as $k$ increases. Submit the plot in the writeup and comment on what you observe.
