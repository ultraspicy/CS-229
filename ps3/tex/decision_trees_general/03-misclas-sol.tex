\begin{answer}

Advantage of multivariate 1) it can deal with more than one variable at the same time, meaning a more complex hyper plane can be denoted by split, thus more powerful the model and be and thus less bias of the model. 2) it can reduce the over fitting in a sense that it needs to consider more variable in one split, so it is less prone to one single dimension of data

Disadvantage 1) it is more computationally expensive in both training and fit process 2) it is more difficult to let user to interpret the result
