% depth 0, root node 0, split by salary with threshold = 32.5, with loss = 2 \\
% depth 1, node 1, parent is node 0.  No split, and no loss.  \\
% depth 1, node 2, parent is node 0.  Split by age with threshold = 52.5, with loss = 1 \\
% depth 2, node 3, parent is node 2.  Split by age with threshold = 23, with loss = 1 \\
% depth 2, node 4, parent is node 2.  No split, and no loss. \\
