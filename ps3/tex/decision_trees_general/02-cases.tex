\item \subquestionpoints{5} A multivariate decision tree is a generalization of univariate decision trees, where more than one attribute can be used in the decision rule for each split. For the same data, learn a multivariate decision tree where each decision rule is a linear classifier that makes decisions based on the sign of $\alpha x_{\text{age}} +\beta x_{\text{income}} -1$. Provide a list of all splits with the classification error reduction at each split, as well as $\alpha$, $\beta$. For $\alpha$ and $\beta$, keep two significant decimals.
