\begin{answer}

(i) 
For regression and predict the salary from college degree and age, we can output the average salary that falls into this node. \\

Changes to make - 1)change the output from a predicted\_class to the average of salary of all its data 2) All reference of node.predicted\_class needs to be corrected to be node.aver\_salary \\
pseudo code as follows\\
    \hspace{10mm} (commented out) predicted\_class = np.argmax(num\_samples\_per\_class) \\
    \hspace{10mm} (commented out) root\_node = Node(predicted\_class=predicted\_class) \\
    root\_node = Node(np.mean(data[index\_of\_salary]))

(ii) 
We still derive a threshold for each split, and minimize the sum of absolute difference between each data and the average of all data in the node. For example, data 1 3 2 fall in the same node, the cost is abs(1 - 2) +  abs(3 - 2) + abs(2 - 2) \\
Changes to make - modify \_misclassification\_loss method \\ 
pseudo code \\
    cost = 0 \\
    aver = mean(data) \\
    for d in data:  cost += abs(data - aver) \\
    return cost
