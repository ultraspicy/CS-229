\item \subquestionpoints{5} List out the cases where Gini loss will stay the same after a split.  Show why these do not violate the strong concavity of the Gini loss.  Briefly explain why these cases do not prevent a fully grown tree from achieving zero Gini loss. (\textbf{Hint}: Recall the definition of strict concavity).
