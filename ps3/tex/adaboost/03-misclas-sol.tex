\begin{answer}

Yes, $\hat{w}_2 > \hat{w}_1$. This is due to the fact that we correctly classify a sample that has more weight than the others, due to the misclassification in the first decision stump. So the second desicion stump has lower weighted error, and give $ln(\frac{1-x}{x})$ is mono decreasing, $\hat{w}_2$ has higher weight
