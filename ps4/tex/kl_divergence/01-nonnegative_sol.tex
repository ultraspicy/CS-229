\begin{answer}

let $f(x) = -log(x)$, then $f^{\prime\prime} = \frac{1}{x^2}$ so $f(x)$ is convex. So according to Jensen's inequality
\begin{equation}
   E[f(X)] \geq f(E[X])
\end{equation}

Let $X = \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}$, from the above equation we take the expectation wrt to distribution P(x),
\begin{equation}
    - \sum_x P(x) \log\left(\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}\right) \ge log\left( \sum_x P(x) \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \right)
\end{equation}

Given $Q(x)$ is also a distribution, it sums to 1. So the above equation can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    \KL(P \| Q) = \sum_x P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right) = - \sum_x P(x) \log\left(\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}\right) \ge log\left( \sum_x P(x) \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} \right) = log(1) = 0
\end{equation}

the problem assumes $P(x)>0, \forall x$. And $\KL(P \| Q) = 0$ is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} = 1, \forall x
\end{equation}

meaning $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are same distribution
