\begin{answer}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Number of iterations taken to converge. semi-supervised EM converges faster than Unsupervised 
    \item Stability (\emph{i.e.,} how much did assignments change with different random initializations?)
    semi-supervised EM is more stable between different trials
    \item Overall quality of assignments. semi-supervised EM has better quality of assignment given it is more close to the actual dataset
\end{enumerate}
