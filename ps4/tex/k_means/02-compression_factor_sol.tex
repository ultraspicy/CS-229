\begin{answer}

We save the image with same size. If not taking any image compression algorithm into account, and just talking about the compression pixel-by-pixel, then the compression is from the reduced color. \\ 

Ideally, we reduced from 24-bit color to 4-bit color, so the compression rate is 6. However, computer use byte as the addressable unit in memory so we still need a byte to store the color, let color be 0, $\cdots$ 15. Moreover, we need to store 16 centroid with 3 bytes each. So a more realistic compression rate is 
\begin{equation}
    r = \frac{512 * 512 * 3}{512 * 512 + 48} \approx 3
\end{equation}
