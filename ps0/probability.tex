\item \points{0} \textbf{Probability and multivariate Gaussians}

  Suppose $X=(X_1,..X_n)$ is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian
  distribution with mean $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $\Sigma$ in $S^n_+$
  (i.e. $\Sigma$ is positive semidefinite).
  This is commonly also written as $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  Describe the random variable $Y = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n$.
  What is the mean and variance?
  Is this a well known distribution, and if so, which?

  The mean of a sum of random variables is the sum of their means. 
  
  Let $\mu = [\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_n]$

  Then $Mean(Y) = Mean(X_1 + \cdots + X_n) = Mean(X_1) + \cdots + Mean(X_n) = \mu_1 + \cdots + \mu_n$

  The variance of a sum of random variables is the sum of their covariances.

  then $Covariance(Y) = \Sigma^n_{i=1}\Sigma^n_{j=1} \sigma_{ij}$

  Y is another Gaussian distribution

  \item
  Now, further suppose that $\Sigma$ is invertible. Find $\mathbb{E}[X^T\Sigma^{-1}X]$.
  (Hint: use the property of trace that $x^TAx = \text{tr}(x^TAx)$).

  $\mathbb{E}[X^T\Sigma^{-1}X] =  \mathbb{E}[\text{tr}(X^T\Sigma^{-1}X)] = \mathbb{E}[\text{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}X X^T)] = tr(\Sigma^{-1}\mathbb{E}[X^T X]) = tr(\Sigma^{-1}(\Sigma + \mu\mu^T)) = tr(I) + tr(\Sigma^{-1}\mu\mu^T) = n + \mu^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu$

  \end{enumerate}
