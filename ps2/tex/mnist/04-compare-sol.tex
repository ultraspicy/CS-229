\begin{answer}

Report the test accuracy

For model baseline, got accuracy: 0.928700, for model regularized, got accuracy: 0.967600 \\ 

Why this outcome makes sense 

By discouraging large weights (thus over-fitting), regularization encourages the model to learn simpler and more general patterns from the data. These patterns are more likely to generalize to unseen data
