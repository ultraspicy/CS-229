\begin{answer}

Given the Poisson distribution, we have the following

\begin{equation}
    h_\theta(x) = E\left[y|x;\theta\right] = \lambda = e^\eta = e^{\theta^\top x}
\end{equation}

The second equation comes from the the mean of Poisson variable is $\lambda$, the third comes from $\eta = ln(\lambda)$ and the last equation comes from the assumption that the natural parameter $\eta$ and the inputs x are related linearly
\end{answer}
